How often it is that Fate places us amongst people whose characters, pursuits, and tastes we do not know! We hesitate how best to melt that barrier of icy reserve and shyness behind which we English remain frozen. How can we speedily break through the reserve which rises up between us and the stranger near us? There is at least one subject of conversation which usually calls forth a response—it is gardening.

Whether our neighbour be politician, soldier, architect, or painter, he will surely listen with interest to the mention of a garden. He will tell us of some newly-discovered plant, a flower show that he went to see, or he will expatiate upon the beauties of South African bulbs. We may be sure that if he himself is no gardener, he has someone dear to him who is a lover of flowers. After a hard day’s work in the City, he will gladly turn his thoughts to the peace and quiet of a walled-in country garden, where the hum of bees[x] and the scent of sweet briar or rosemary bring happiness and contentment.
It is the same with country people, who live in our quiet English villages that are as yet unspoilt by the dust of motors and the noise of holiday-makers. A little chat over the garden wall in the cool of evening, about the luxuriant growth of the peas, the beauty of madonna lilies gleaming white against the dark timber of the cottage, or the special size of this year’s roses, will often make a lasting friendship. No make-believe pastime is gardening with them; it is their true recreation. Their lives have been passed amidst fields, trees, beautiful hedgerows, and consequently they look upon these objects as friends. Surely this love of Nature is wholesome both to body and mind, and greatly to be encouraged by all who wish for the well-being of England and her Colonies.
